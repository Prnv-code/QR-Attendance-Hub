# QR-Attendance-Hub
The QR Attendance System is a Flask-based web app that simplifies attendance tracking using QR codes. Teachers generate session-specific QR codes, while students scan to mark their presence, with data stored in a SQLite database. It offers dashboards for both roles, complete with history and reports.
